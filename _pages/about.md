## Hello, Merhaba, Hola 👋! I am Halidu (Khalid)
### AI in Healthcare | ML | NLP | CV  
I completed the Erasmus Mundus Joint Master’s Degree Program (<a href="https://www.master-ediss.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EDISS</a>), earning a Master’s in Computer Engineering from Åbo Akademi University, Finland, and a Master’s in Intelligent Systems with a specialization in Computer Vision and Data Science from the University of the Balearic Islands, Spain.

My research interests lie in machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing. I’m especially interested in inclusive and reliable AI methods. I’m drawn to problems that can be tackled with vision–language and other multimodal models that work well across languages and cultures, with a particular focus on under-resourced communities. I’m also interested in combining ideas from ML, CV, and NLP to develop robust, interpretable AI for high-stakes domains such as healthcare. This includes designing multimodal systems that integrate diverse data sources, stay reliable as data and conditions change, and offer clear, evidence-based explanations that users can trust.
