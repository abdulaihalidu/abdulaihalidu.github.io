## Hello, Merhaba, Hola 👋! I am Halidu (Khalid)
### AI in Healthcare | ML | NLP | CV  
I completed the Erasmus Mundus Joint Master’s Degree Program (EDISS), earning a Master’s in Data Science and Software Engineering from Åbo Akademi University, Finland, and a Master’s in Intelligent Systems with a specialization in Computer Vision and Data Science from the University of the Balearic Islands, Spain.

My research focuses on developing robust, interpretable AI methods for healthcare applications using machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision. I design models that can combine diverse types of  data, remain reliable when data or conditions change, and connect their predictions to clear, evidence-based explanations that is trustworthy.
