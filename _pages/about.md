## Hello, Merhaba, Hola 👋! I am Halidu (Khalid)
### AI in Healthcare | ML | NLP | CV  
I completed the Erasmus Mundus Joint Master’s Degree Program (<a href="https://www.master-ediss.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EDISS</a>), earning a Master’s in Computer Engineering from Åbo Akademi University, Finland, and a Master’s in Intelligent Systems with a specialization in Computer Vision and Data Science from the University of the Balearic Islands, Spain.

My research interests lie in machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing. I’m especially interested in inclusive and reliable AI methods. I’m drawn to problems that can be tackled with vision–language and other multimodal models that work well across languages and cultures, with a particular focus on under-resourced communities. I’m also interested in combining ideas from ML, CV, and NLP to develop robust, interpretable AI for high-stakes domains such as healthcare. This includes designing multimodal systems that integrate diverse data sources, stay reliable as data and conditions change, and offer clear, evidence-based explanations that users can trust.

## Miscellaneous

As a young person who has been working my way up over the years, I've learned a few principles in life that I find worth sharing:

- If it is to be done **for you**, then it must be done **by you**. No one is more capable of doing something for you than you are for yourself.
- There will always seem to be better options elsewhere, but if you focus on where you are and what you have, you can make the options you already have even better.
- You can get what you want if you want it enough, but always question whether it's worth what you're sacrificing in order to get it.
- People don’t care about potential; in a results-obsessed world, even the least capable person with proof will usually be chosen over the most gifted person with only promise.
