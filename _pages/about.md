## Hello — Merhaba — Hola 👋 I’m Halidu (Khalid)

**PhD Researcher @ Åbo Akademi University** · **AI for Healthcare** · **ML / NLP / CV**

I’m a doctoral researcher at Åbo Akademi University, supervised by [Prof. Sebastien Lafond](https://research.abo.fi/sv/persons/sebastien-lafond/) and [Hergys Rexha](https://research.abo.fi/sv/persons/hergys-rexha/). My work sits at the intersection of machine learning and drug delivery: I build predictive models that estimate whether **nanoparticles can cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB)**. The goal is to help researchers **screen and prioritize** large numbers of nanoparticle designs and focus lab time on the candidates most likely to work. This research is part of the EU Horizon project [NAP4DIVE](https://nap4dive.eu/).

Before the PhD, I completed the Erasmus Mundus Joint Master’s programme ([EDISS](https://www.master-ediss.eu/)), earning:
- an **MSc in Computer Engineering** from Åbo Akademi University (Finland), and  
- an **MSc in Intelligent Systems**, specialized in **Computer Vision and Data Science**, from the University of the Balearic Islands (Spain).

More broadly, I work across **machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing**, with a steady interest in **reliable and inclusive AI**. I’m especially drawn to **multimodal** problems—systems that combine vision, language, and structured data—and to building methods that still behave well when languages, cultures, or real-world conditions shift. A big part of what motivates me is impact: creating models that are **interpretable**, **robust**, and suited for **high-stakes settings** like healthcare—where performance isn’t enough unless the reasoning is transparent and the outputs are dependable.

## Miscellaneous

As a young person who has been working my way up over the years, I've learned a few principles in life that I find worth sharing:

- If it is to be done **for you**, then it must be done **by you**. No one is more capable of doing something for you than you are for yourself.
- There will always seem to be better options elsewhere, but if you focus on where you are and what you have, you can make the options you already have even better.
- You can get what you want if you want it enough, but always question whether it's worth what you're sacrificing in order to get it.
- People don’t care about potential; in a results-obsessed world, even the least capable person with proof will usually be chosen over the most gifted person with only promise.
