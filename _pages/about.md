## Hello, Merhaba, Hola ðŸ‘‹! I am Halidu (Khalid)
### AI in Healthcare | NLP | CV | Machine Learning Researcher  
I completed the Erasmus Mundus Joint Masterâ€™s Degree Program (EDISS), earning a Masterâ€™s in Data Science and Software Engineering from Ã…bo Akademi University, Finland, and a Masterâ€™s in Intelligent Systems with a specialization in Computer Vision and Data Science from the University of the Balearic Islands, Spain.

My research Interest Include Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing, with a particular focus on designing AI systems that truly 'understand' what they 'see', and can communicate in a natural language (with specific applications in healthcare)
